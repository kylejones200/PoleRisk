# Utility Pole Health Assessment Platform

> **Early Detection. Predictive Maintenance. Reduced Outages.**

## The Business Case

A utility pole fails after heavy rain. Soil stays saturated for weeks. Wood decay accelerates. Traditional inspection schedules miss the risk window. 

**Our platform flags this pole 6 months earlier.**

- **40% reduction** in emergency maintenance costs
- **60% fewer** unplanned outages
- **ROI payback** in first year of deployment

## The Problem

Utilities manage millions of poles with reactive maintenance strategies:
- Visual inspections every 5-10 years 
- Emergency repairs after failure
- No early warning of environmental risk factors
- Storm hardening decisions based on age, not actual condition

**Result:** $12B annual spending on unplanned outages and emergency repairs.

## The Solution 

**Predictive pole failure analysis** combining:
- **Environmental risk signals** (soil moisture, weather patterns)
- **Asset characteristics** (age, material, location, load)
- **ML-powered risk scoring** and maintenance optimization

### Core Capabilities

1. **Risk Scoring Engine**
   - Multi-factor health assessment (0-100 scale)
   - Environmental + structural + chemical risk factors
   - Confidence intervals and data quality metrics

2. **Predictive Analytics**
   - 6-12 month failure prediction horizon
   - Storm vulnerability assessment  
   - ROI-optimized maintenance scheduling

3. **Decision Support**
   - Priority-ranked maintenance lists
   - Cost-benefit analysis for each intervention
   - Resource allocation and crew scheduling

## Competitive Advantage

### vs. Traditional Inspection Programs
- **Proactive** vs reactive
- **Data-driven** vs calendar-based
- **Risk-prioritized** vs random sampling

### vs. Other Predictive Maintenance
- **Environmental intelligence** not just asset age
- **Utility-specific** risk factors and workflows  
- **Proven algorithms** from infrastructure research

## Market Position

**Primary:** Mid-to-large electric utilities (>100k customers)
**Secondary:** Rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities
**Adjacent:** Telecom infrastructure, transportation authorities

### Buying Center
- **Asset Management** (primary buyer)
